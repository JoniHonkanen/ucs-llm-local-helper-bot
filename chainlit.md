# Welcome to GPT Lab Sein√§joki Project

This exciting initiative leverages cutting-edge technologies including **LLM (Large Language Models)**, **LangChain**, and **LangGraph** to create powerful and intuitive chatbot solutions.

## About the Project

This project aims to showcase the potential of advanced language models in building interactive and intelligent chatbots. By integrating various tools and frameworks, we strive to deliver seamless and efficient user experiences.

Our mission is to develop a demo chatbot capable of determining product compatibility based on identifiers provided by users. The chatbot will utilize language models to perform database searches and deduce the appropriate actions based on search results.

## Key Technologies

- **LLM (Large Language Models)**: Harnessing the power of large-scale language models to understand and generate human-like text.
- **LangChain**: A powerful framework for building complex language model applications.
- **LangGraph**: Enabling robust graph-based data structures and interactions within the chatbot.

We are thrilled to have you on board and look forward to exploring the capabilities of these technologies together.

Let's get started!
